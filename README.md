### Dockerized deployment for a wishlist platform

This training project focused on containerizing and deploying a full-stack app with Docker and docker-compose.

As part of the task, I:
- Dockerized the Node.js backend and React frontend with multi-stage builds
- Configured PostgreSQL as a containerized database
- Set up environment variables and .env.example files
- Wrote a docker-compose.yml to orchestrate backend, frontend, and DB // describe ?
- Set up Nginx and HTTPS with Let's Encrypt
- Deployed the stack on a remote Ubuntu server
  
The live deployment is no longer available â€” domain and hosting were temporary.

#### Technologies:
- Backend: Node.js, Nest.js
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Containerization: Docker, Docker Compose
- Web Server: Nginx
- SSL Certification: Let's Encrypt
- Deployment Environment: Ubuntu Server
